# Order-Fulfillment-at-Streamline-Logistics
This repository contains the resources and documentation for developing an interactive Excel dashboard aimed at improving order fulfillment processes for Streamline Logistics.

### Project Overview
Streamline Logistics, a reputable logistics company, is facing challenges with order backlogs, customer dissatisfaction, and rising operational costs. This project aims to address these issues by leveraging data-driven insights to enhance operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

### Objectives
- Efficient Resource Allocation
- Proactive Monitoring
- Cost Reduction
- Customer Satisfaction


**Tools Used**: Microsoft Excel, Pivot Tables

### Data Description
The dataset used in this project includes:

- `Order ID`: Unique identifier for each order.
- `Delivery Address`: Destination for the order.
- `Order Timestamp`: Date and time of order placement.
- `Order Status`: Current status (In Progress or Completed).
- `Driver ID`: Identifier for the delivery driver.
- `Vehicle Info`: Details of the delivery vehicle.
- `Current Location`: Driver's location during delivery.
- `Delivery Time`: Total time taken for delivery.
- `Delays`: Delays encountered during delivery.
- `Customer Feedback`: Feedback on the delivery experience.
- `Route`: Route taken by the driver.
- `Delivery Zone`: Geographic zone of delivery.
- `Allocation Rules`: Rules for resource allocation.
- `Timestamp for Tracking`: Date and time of tracking data points.

### Key Insights
1. Order Backlog: Over 50% of orders are backlogged, impacting customer satisfaction.
2. Feedback and Delays: Positive feedback orders have slightly higher delays, indicating other factors influencing satisfaction.
3. Driver Performance: Certain drivers have higher delays, suggesting areas for improvement.
4. Route Delays: Specific routes consistently experience delays, requiring optimization.
5. Vehicle Delays: Bike C is associated with higher delays, indicating potential inefficiencies.
6. Allocation Rule Inefficiencies: Expedited rules often result in longer delays, necessitating a review.

### Recommendations
1. Resource Allocation: Increase resources to address backlogs.
2. Driver Training: Provide training and tools for drivers with higher delays.
3. Route Optimization: Analyze and optimize high-delay routes.
4. Vehicle Allocation: Reassess the use of Bike C for certain deliveries.
5. Review Allocation Rules: Ensure expedited rules are effective.
6. Enhanced Communication: Improve customer communication regarding order status.

### Dashboard Design
The Excel dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of order fulfillment performance, tracking:

- Order Status
- Delivery Performance
- Customer Feedback
- Driver and Vehicle Performance
- Allocation Rule Effectiveness
